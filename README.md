# DNA
Short Tandem Repeats (STRs) are short sequences of DNA that repeat consecutively numerous times at specific locations in an organism's genome. The number of times a particular STR repeats varies a lot in a population and, because of this associated genetic diversity, they form the basis of forensic analysis and DNA profiling.

This program takes, as input, two files; a CSV file of individuals and their STRs, and a DNA sequence text file. It then iterates over the DNA sequence to calculate each STR sequence and their repeat number in order to match the DNA sequence to the individuals in the CSV file, if there is indeed a match.
